## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Current Tests
- ✅ Basic smoke tests
- ✅ Data validation tests

### Recommended Additional Tests
- [ ] API endpoint integration tests
- [ ] Authentication flow tests
- [ ] Photo upload tests
- [ ] Database transaction tests
- [ ] E2E tests with Playwright

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Implemented
- ✅ Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) for auth
- ✅ CORS configured for specific origins
- ✅ Service role key stored securely in env vars
- ✅ Public storage bucket with authenticated write

### Recommended
- [ ] Rate limiting on API endpoints
- [ ] Input sanitization for user data
- [ ] CSRF protection
- [ ] API key rotation policy
- [ ] Regular security audits

---

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

### Implemented
- ✅ Next.js SSR for fast initial loads
- ✅ CDN delivery via Vercel Edge Network
- ✅ Image optimization ready (Supabase Storage)
- ✅ Database connection pooling (Prisma)

### Recommended
- [ ] Add caching headers for static assets
- [ ] Implement ISR for semi-static pages
- [ ] Add Redis for session caching
- [ ] Optimize database queries with indexes
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for images

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Ephemeral Filesystem (Resolved)
- **Issue**: Railway filesystem is ephemeral
- **Solution**: ✅ Migrated to Supabase Storage
- **Status**: Photos now persist permanently

### Deployment Protection
- **Issue**: Vercel deployment protection blocks SSR API calls
- **Solution**: ✅ SSR fetches directly from Railway API
- **Status**: Working as expected
