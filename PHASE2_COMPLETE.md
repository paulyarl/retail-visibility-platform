- Gallery refreshes items list on photo changes

## How to Use

### 1. Start the Development Server

doppler run --config local -- pnpm dev

# Terminal 2: Web
cd apps/web
doppler run --config local -- pnpm dev
```

### 2. Navigate to Items Page
- Go to http://localhost:3000/items
- Or http://localhost:3000/t/{tenantId}/items (tenant-scoped)
- Login if not already authenticated

### 3. Open Photo Gallery
- Click the "Gallery" button next to any item
- Modal opens with photo gallery for that item

### 4. Upload Photos
- Click "Add Photo" button

- **Edit Alt/Caption**: Hover ‚Üí click "Edit" ‚Üí enter text ‚Üí click "Save"
- **Delete**: Hover ‚Üí click "Delete" ‚Üí confirm
- **View Count**: See "Photos (X/11)" at top

### 6. Verify on Product Page
- Navigate to /products/{itemId}
- Gallery should display all photos
- Primary photo shown large, others as thumbnails

## Features Implemented

### Upload
- ‚úÖ Client-side compression (1024px max width, 0.8 quality, JPEG)
- ‚úÖ 11-photo limit enforced (1 primary + 10 additional)
- ‚úÖ Visual feedback when at limit (button disabled)

- ‚úÖ Photo count indicator
- ‚úÖ Empty state message
- ‚úÖ Hover overlay with actions

### Actions
- ‚úÖ Set Primary: Swaps positions with current primary
- ‚úÖ Edit: Inline form for alt/caption with save/cancel
- ‚úÖ Delete: Confirmation dialog, removes photo, re-packs positions
- ‚úÖ All actions refresh parent items list

### Integration
- ‚úÖ Modal overlay with close button
- ‚úÖ Item name/SKU displayed in header
- ‚úÖ Calls backend API endpoints
- ‚úÖ Updates item.imageUrl when primary changes
- ‚úÖ Product page already displays galleries

## API Endpoints Used

- `GET /api/items/:id/photos` - Load photos
- `POST /api/items/:id/photos` - Upload photo
- `PUT /api/items/:id/photos/:photoId` - Update alt/caption or set primary
- `DELETE /api/items/:id/photos/:photoId` - Delete photo

All proxied through `/api/*` with authentication handled automatically.

## What's NOT in Phase 2

‚ùå Drag-and-drop reordering (can add later)  
‚ùå Bulk reorder UI (endpoint exists, UI not built)  
‚ùå Image cropping/editing tools  
‚ùå Multiple file selection (upload one at a time)  
‚ùå E2E tests (Phase 3)  

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Upload first photo ‚Üí becomes primary (position 0)
- [ ] Upload second photo ‚Üí position 1
- [ ] Upload third photo ‚Üí position 2
- [ ] Set photo 2 as primary ‚Üí positions swap (2‚Üí0, 0‚Üí2)
- [ ] Edit alt/caption ‚Üí saves and displays
- [ ] Delete middle photo ‚Üí positions re-pack (0,1,3 ‚Üí 0,1,2)
- [ ] Upload 11 photos ‚Üí "Add Photo" button disabled
- [ ] Try to upload 12th ‚Üí error message
- [ ] Close and reopen gallery ‚Üí photos persist
- [ ] Visit /products/{id} ‚Üí gallery displays all photos
- [ ] Primary photo shows large, others as thumbnails

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Delete all photos ‚Üí empty state message
- [ ] Upload fails ‚Üí error message shown
- [ ] Network error ‚Üí graceful handling
- [ ] Refresh during upload ‚Üí state recovers
- [ ] Multiple items ‚Üí gallery shows correct photos per item

## Known Limitations

1. **No drag-and-drop reorder**: Users must use "Set Primary" button. Bulk reorder endpoint exists but UI not built.
2. **Single file upload**: Can't select multiple files at once (upload one at a time).
3. **No image preview before upload**: File is compressed and uploaded immediately.
4. **No undo**: Deletes are permanent (could add confirmation with undo toast).
5. **No image editing**: No crop/rotate/filters (could add later).

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 3 (Optional)
- Drag-and-drop reordering with visual feedback
- Multiple file selection
- Image preview before upload
- Crop/rotate tools
- Undo/redo for deletes
- E2E tests
- Feed publisher mapping (imageLink + additionalImageLinks)

### Performance
- Lazy load thumbnails
- Generate multiple sizes (small/medium/large)
- CDN integration
- Image optimization on server

### UX
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Bulk actions (delete multiple, reorder multiple)
- Copy/paste images between items
- Image search/filter

## Success Criteria

- [x] Gallery component created
- [x] Multi-upload with compression
- [x] Thumbnail grid display
- [x] Set primary functionality
- [x] Delete with confirmation
- [x] Inline alt/caption editing
- [x] 11-photo limit enforced
- [x] Items page integration
- [x] Modal overlay
- [x] Auto-refresh on changes
- [x] Product page displays galleries

## Deployment Notes

1. **Backend must be deployed first** (Phase 1 migration)
2. **No breaking changes** - fully backward compatible
3. **Existing single-image flow still works** via legacy imageUrl
4. **Product page already supports galleries** - will work immediately

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Remove "Gallery" button from ItemsClient
2. Restore single "Photo" upload button
3. Backend remains functional (no rollback needed)
4. Product page falls back to single image

---

**Phase 2 Complete!** üéâ

Users can now manage multi-image galleries for their products. The UI is intuitive, responsive, and fully integrated with the backend.

**Next Steps**: Test in development, gather feedback, optionally add drag-and-drop reordering and E2E tests.
