**Document Owner:** Growth & Marketing Team  
**Date:** 2025-11-06  
**Status:** Strategic Framework

---

## Executive Summary

**Recommended Approach:** Multi-channel digital strategy with Clover as the primary wedge

**Priority Order:**
1. **Clover App Marketplace** (Highest ROI, lowest CAC)
2. **Google Ads** (High-intent, scalable)
3. **LinkedIn + Facebook Ads** (B2B targeting)
4. **Content Marketing + SEO** (Long-term, compounding)
5. **Strategic Partnerships** (Clover resellers, POS dealers)

**Why NOT Door-to-Door:**

**Why Digital-First:**
- ✅ Low CAC ($15-50 per customer)
- ✅ Scales infinitely
- ✅ Measurable ROI
- ✅ Matches your product (online platform)

```

---

## Phase 5: Strategic Partnerships (Months 3-12)

### **Why Partnerships**

**Leverage Existing Networks:**
- Clover resellers have merchant relationships
- POS dealers need value-add services
- Accountants/bookkeepers advise clients
- Business consultants recommend tools

---

### **Partnership Types**

#### **1. Clover Resellers & POS Dealers**

**Value Proposition:**
```
To Reseller:
"Increase your Clover sales by offering a complete solution:
- Clover POS (hardware + software)
- + Our platform (Google Shopping + Storefront)
= Complete retail solution

We'll give you:

```

**Target Partners:**

```

---

## Phase 6: Why NOT Door-to-Door

### **The Math Doesn't Work**

**Door-to-Door Economics:**
```
Time per visit: 2-3 hours (travel + pitch)
Visits per day: 3-4
Conversion rate: 5-10%
Customers per day: 0.3
Customers per month: 6 (20 working days)
Cost per rep: $4,000/mo (salary + expenses)
CAC: $667 per customer

vs Digital Marketing:
Google Ads CAC: $143
Clover Marketplace CAC: $5
Content Marketing CAC: $0
```

**Scalability:**
```
Door-to-Door:
- 1 rep = 6 customers/mo
- 10 reps = 60 customers/mo
- Cost: $40,000/mo
- Not scalable beyond local area

Digital Marketing:
- $40,000/mo budget = 280 customers/mo
- Scales infinitely
- Works 24/7
- Global reach
```

---

### **When Door-to-Door MIGHT Make Sense**

**Only in these scenarios:**
1. **Enterprise/Organization tier** ($999/mo)
   - High contract value justifies in-person
   - Complex needs require consultation
   - Multi-location chains need hand-holding

2. **Strategic partnerships**
   - Meeting with Clover resellers
   - Presenting to business associations
   - Building relationships with key partners

3. **Local market validation** (first 10 customers)
   - Test messaging
   - Gather feedback
   - Refine product
   - Then switch to digital

**But NOT for:**
- ❌ Google-Only tier ($29/mo) - too low value
- ❌ Starter tier ($49/mo) - too low value
- ❌ Mass market acquisition - doesn't scale
