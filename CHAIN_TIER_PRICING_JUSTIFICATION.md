**Date**: November 6, 2024  
**Issue**: Chain tiers underpriced vs individual tiers  
**Priority**: HIGH - Revenue Optimization

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL PRICING ISSUE

### **Current Problem**:
Chain tiers provide MASSIVELY more value but aren't priced accordingly!

| Tier Type | Current Pricing | Value Delivered |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Individual Professional** | $499/mo | 1 location, 5K SKUs |
| **Chain Professional** | ??? | 25 locations, 12.5K SKUs |
| **Individual Enterprise** | $999/mo | 1 location, unlimited SKUs |
| **Chain Enterprise** | ??? | Unlimited locations, unlimited SKUs |

**Issue**: Chain tiers should be MUCH higher than individual tiers!

---

## 💰 RECOMMENDED CHAIN TIER PRICING

### **Pricing Strategy**:
Chain tiers should reflect the **per-location value multiplied by location count**, with a volume discount.

### **Individual Tiers** (Current - Correct):
- **Starter**: $49/mo (1 location, 500 SKUs)
- **Professional**: $499/mo (1 location, 5K SKUs)
- **Enterprise**: $999/mo (1 location, unlimited SKUs)
- **Organization**: $999/mo (unlimited locations, 10K shared SKUs, 8 propagation types)

### **Chain Tiers** (Recommended):

| Tier | Price | Locations | Total SKUs | Per-Location Value | Discount |
|------|-------|-----------|------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Chain Starter** | **$199/mo** | 5 | 2,500 | $49 × 5 = $245 | 19% off |
| **Chain Professional** | **$1,999/mo** | 25 | 12,500 | $499 × 25 = $12,475 | 84% off |
| **Chain Enterprise** | **$4,999/mo** | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited | Custom |
